For now, there are posts about LSA, LDA, and Word2Vec. LSA and LDA are coded in R, while Word2Vec are coded in Python with TensorFlow, where I use TensorFlow 1.0 and Python 3.5.

For Word2Vec, the input data are files with each line representing one sentence. Just use the word2vec.py where the batch.py will be imported for use.

There will be exploration of RNN posted recently.
Being excited for the new and last semester!!!
